# 2022-23-DGB-Prediction-Contest

This is a test app for trying to figure out how to turn the 2022-23 prediction contest into a web app

UPDATE 23 MAR 2023: THIS DID NOT WORK, I CANNOT GET THE LIBRARY TO COMMUNICATE WITH GOOGLE SHEETS EFFECTIVELY. KEEPING THIS AROUND TO POTENTIALLY LEARN FROM IF I TRY THIS AGAIN, THOUGH I'LL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT, BETTER DOCUMENTED LIBRARY FOR INTERACTING WITH GOOGLE SHEETS IN THE FUTURE. IF I FOUND SUCH A LIBRARY, THE REST OF THIS SHOULD WORK AS A FOUNDATION FOR THAT APP TO OPERATE ON STREAMLIT.
